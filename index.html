                    I started this project because of <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/">leetcode 37</a> and
                    because my father was working on sudoku puzzles from the newspaper.
                    I largely figured out the recursive solver on my own, but I did get a bit of help from the solutions
                    people posted on leetcode (e.g., I recognized that my code was doing extra recursive calls).
                    <br><br>
                    I then rewrote the solver in javascript so my father could use a web interface.
                    This was my first attempt at javascript, and I got help from Google and Bard--especially for the
                    input and output.
                    <br><br>
                    I went for a minimalist design and think it looks good and works well.
